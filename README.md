## üì• Installation

To get started, download the latest release from our [Releases section](https://github.com/mr441/szedo_harvestzones/releases). Once downloaded, follow these steps:

1. Extract the files to your FiveM resources directory.
2. Add `start szedo_harvestzones` to your server configuration file (`server.cfg`).
3. Restart your server.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

You can customize the script by editing the `config.lua` file. Here are some key settings:

```lua
Config = {}

Config.HarvestZones = {
    { name = "Wheat", coords = vector3(1000, 2000, 30), material = "wheat" },
    { name = "Corn", coords = vector3(1100, 2100, 30), material = "corn" },
}

Config.NotificationType = "okoknotify" -- Change to your preferred notification system
Config.ProgressBarDuration = 5000 -- Duration in milliseconds
```

Feel free to add or modify zones according to your server's needs.

## üéÆ Usage

To start harvesting, simply walk into a designated harvest zone. You will receive a notification prompting you to begin the process. 

1. Press the interaction key (default: E).
2. Wait for the progress bar to complete.
3. Collect your materials!

## üõ†Ô∏è Commands

The following commands are available for managing harvest zones:

- `/addzone`: Add a new harvest zone.
- `/removezone`: Remove an existing harvest zone.
- `/listzones`: List all active harvest zones.

Use these commands to easily manage your harvest zones in-game.

## üì¢ Notifications

Notifications help keep players informed about their actions. You can choose from various notification systems. The default is `okoknotify`, but you can change this in the `config.lua` file. 

Here's an example of how to send a notification:

```lua
if Config.NotificationType == "okoknotify" then
    TriggerEvent('okokNotify:Alert', 'Harvesting', 'You are harvesting wheat!', 5000, 'success')
end
```

## üìä Progress Bar

The progress bar gives players a visual indication of their harvesting status. You can customize the duration in the `config.lua` file. The default duration is set to 5000 milliseconds (5 seconds).

```lua
exports['progressbar']:startUI(Config.ProgressBarDuration, 'Harvesting...')
```

## üé® Customization

You can further customize the look and feel of the notifications and progress bar by editing the respective files in the script. For example, you can change colors, icons, and sounds to match your server's theme.
